# Chest-X-Rays-Pneumonia-Detection

CNN was trained for detecting Pneumonia given Chest X-Rays. After training the model, test accuracy of 94.56% and a recall score of 0.97 was achieved.

## Dataset

[Kaggle | Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia) was used for training the model.

This dataset has 5863 images for the 2 classes.
